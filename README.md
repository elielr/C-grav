We consider the motion of a free-falling particle in a gravitational field generated by N planets (point masses) until it crashes either in one of them or on the border of the frame (maybe an electromagnetic analogy could be more adequate than a gravitational one). 
With a fixed starting point, its full trajectory is then completely determined by its initial speed vector.

Our goal is to maximize the duration of this fall before crash (or explore the possibility of infinite trajectory).

To get an idea of the problem at hand, here is a display of a random initial configuration (0,0) and a map of the score function (1,1) as well as a crash site map (0,1) and an exemple of trajectory for a good initial speed (1,0). 

While the problem is easy to write, the amount of discontinuities and the sensitivity to initial conditions, especially in regions of interest with large scores, sparked my curiosity (there is always something fascinating about chaos and fractals).
